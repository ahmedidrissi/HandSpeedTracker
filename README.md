# Hand Speed Tracker

## Description
This is a simple program that tracks the speed of both hands based on a video file. It uses the [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) library to detect the hands and the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) library to read the video file and display the results. The program also uses the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) library to display the results in a graph. The coordinates of the hands are saved in a CSV file.
